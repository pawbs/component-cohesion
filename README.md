# component-cohesion

Icebreaker: First, discuss with your pair what kind of setup for modules/dynamic libraries you have in your current/past projects. (whether or not they worked well, was easy to maintain, how large your teams were for each component etc etc)



Practical Exersize: In this project are currently two modules: a "core", where almost all the functionality is isolated to the Media class, and a smaller "podcast" module which has a method for transcribing subtitles (pretend theres code in there)
The smaller "podcast" module exists just as an example to setup multiple modules in a project. 

The exersize itself is to put on your "architect hat" and discuss how (or if you should) split the core module further into separate modules to adhere to the three principles in the chapter.
